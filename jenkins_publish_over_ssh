The path to key should be the path to the private key id_rsa.

Not the public one id_rsa.pub (which is indeed an invalid... private key)

Creating an SSH key pair has generated:

/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa (private key)
/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public key)
Use the old PEM format (not the new OpenSSH one)

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jenkins" -m PEM -P "" -f /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa
For an SSH session to be opened, the public key need to be copied over to the remote server, in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys.
If you have the remote ubuntu user password, you can use the ssh-copy-id command, as seen here:

ssh-copy-id -i /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@remoteserverip
